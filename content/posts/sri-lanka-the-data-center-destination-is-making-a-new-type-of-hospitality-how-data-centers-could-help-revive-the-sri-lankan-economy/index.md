### A new type of hospitality: How data centers could help revive the Sri Lankan economy

Historically, Sri Lanka has been an attractive destination for traders and travellers alike, and over time, our nation has become synonymous with hospitality. Prior to COVID-19, tourism was among the most dynamic sectors in our economy, generating between US$ 3 and 4 billion annually.\
\
With the movement of people and goods severely restricted globally, tourism and many other crucial sources of foreign exchange will continue to face severe limitations. While all steps must be taken to provide these sectors with the support they need, it is of equal importance to also explore new avenues for growth.\
\
Among the few positive developments to emerge out these disruptions has been the phenomenon of Work From Home (WFH). Leveraging these capabilities, many enterprises have been able continue their operations relatively uninterrupted, and in some instances, at an even greater scale than prior to the pandemic.\
\
Fuelling these emerging opportunities are powerful new capabilities in digitalization, that in turn rest on a foundation of critical technology infrastructure. This includes everything from high- speed internet capabilities to data hosting. This is where we believe Sri Lanka has the potential to leverage on a new kind of hospitality. Not for people, but for data.
