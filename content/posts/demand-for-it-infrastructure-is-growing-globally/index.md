Digitalization is the new norm and there is an escalating demand for IT Infrastructure services. Increasingly, instead of building up their individual server capacity, companies are outsourcing data storage requirements to third party data centers in order to centralize and accelerate shared IT operations and equipment. Data center migration services were projected to grow by 24% by 2024. Post pandemic, 87% of global IT decision makers seek to accelerate this journey.

### Data centers can facilitate a new breed of technologies

A data center is a facility that centralizes an organization's shared IT operations and equipment for the purposes of storing, processing, and disseminating business critical data and applications. Modern data centers provide high-grade facilities and go beyond colocation into cloud and managed services.

While this was already a common trend prior to COVID-19, today the demand for server space and managed services is growing exponentially in Sri Lanka, and more so across the South Asian region. This positions us exceptionally well to service the rapidly rising demand for data hosting emerging out of local corporates, and regional enterprises seeking cost and operational advantages. If managed correctly, Sri Lankan data centers could be turned into a virtual goldmine.

### Local growth, global potential

Sri Lanka was ranked among the top 25 destinations of A.T. Kearney's 2019 Global Services Location Index (GSLI) – a leading benchmark of national competitiveness in tech-services. This classification was based on financial attractiveness, skills and availability of qualified personnel, and a welcoming business environment, of which, our people remain one of our best assets.\
\
Additionally, Sri Lanka is ranked the second best in the world for digital nomads, scoring, 238 out of 320 points. Colombo is also recognised as the fourth best city in the world to work remotely from. In calculating the digital nomad score index, cost of living, safety, average internet speed, and technology adoption, were considered. As much as Sri Lanka is known for its glamorous natural beauty, it has the potential to take centre stage as one of the world’s best tech hubs.\
\
Building on the strong momentum gained so far will require greater utilization of the globally competitive data hosting capabilities that have been developed, and greater investment to boost capacity even further.\
\
Most of Sri Lanka’s largest and most dynamic enterprises are already taking advantage of this quality infrastructure, resulting in significant competitive advantage. It allows them to meet their aspirations for digitalization while containing investments and operating costs.

### Unique advantages

There are many other factors working in Sri Lanka’s favour, including a highly favourable policy towards attracting IT investment while developing local talent. The Government is also working towards ambitious targets for implementation of e-governance initiatives.\
\
The country is increasingly recognized as an ideal location for new types of opportunities. New job categories – including a uniquely vibrant start-up culture and new approaches to work are also emerging, as evidenced by the rapid expansion of co-working spaces like Hatch. Sri Lanka is also introducing critical new data security regulations. The proposed Data protection bill is expected to establish the necessary institutional framework and safeguard the digital ecosystem.\
\
All of these factors point to the start of a new phase of Sri Lanka’s development. Unlike previous eras however, in the ‘new normal’ our knowledge and IT expertise will be our greatest strength.

### Positive progress already underway

Globally data centers receive their core certifications from the Uptime Institute, and The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). Uptime Institute certifies design and build of data centers based on evaluation of standardized and precise requirements, while TIA is responsible for setting standards on guaranteed availability levels (942 Rate) in the following tiers:

Already, Sri Lanka is home to two Tier 3 certified data centers operated by Dialog and SLT in Malabe and Pitipana. Meanwhile, construction of the new data center at Orion City by OrionStellar has already been completed and the facility is now ready to go live as Sri Lanka’s first carrier-neutral and high-density data center. This is the first Tier 3 certified Data Center within Colombo city limits.\
\
Together with ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (ISO 27001) certifications, Sri Lanka will also be able to offer confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security best practices on par with some of the most advanced in the region.

### Geographic advantages

In addition to its globally competitive technical expertise, Sri Lanka serves as a vibrant maritime link between East and West.\
\
Moreover, Sri Lanka’s location in the North-Western region of the Indo Australian plate, well away from the destructive plate boundary, means it's safe from seismic events. Accordingly, our earthquake hazard is classified as very low with less than a 2% chance of a potentially damaging earthquake in Sri Lanka in the next 50 years. In terms of data storage, this is an unbeatable advantage as even a small seismic event can have serious repercussions on a live data center.\
\
Sri Lanka is a tropical country with favourable weather patterns and free from most natural hazards. There is no snow fall or hurricanes and tornadoes are rare, offering further peace of mind to potential offshoring clients.\
\
Sri Lanka’s location, and its historical affinity for communications technology means that today, the island is connected to no less than eight international submarine cables. This enables Sri Lankan data centers to offer globally competitive connectivity and reliability. By comparison, regional leaders like Singapore have seven international cables, whilst Hong Kong has 11.\
\
Like Hong Kong, Sri Lanka is ideally positioned off the mainland of India, a large and economically vibrant neighbor with strong trade and diplomatic ties. These pre-existing links could easily serve as a catalyst for new opportunities in Sri Lanka.\
\
Our central location on a global scale also means that Sri Lanka is never too far from any time zone, meaning that local IT and engineering teams can easily connect with global enterprises during their operating hours. In many ways, this represents an opportunity to serve as a virtual gateway between East and West.

### Electricity supply & connectivity

Relative to its regional peers, Sri Lanka has a reliable and high-quality supply of power with 93% electrification coverage and an uninterrupted power supply. Also, being connected to eight international submarine cables, Sri Lanka ensures an ample redundancy and connectivity. Moreover, broadband, leased line and satellite connectivity is widely available with high-speed connectivity and seamless delivery of hosted applications.

### Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)

Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and its reciprocal Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCIE) are widely accepted benchmarking standards in measuring power efficiency. The Uptime Institute also recommends a comprehensive benchmark named Corporate Average Data Center Efficiency (CADE).

|     |      |                     |
| --- | ---- | ------------------- |
| PUE | DCiE | Level of Efficiency |
| 3.0 | 33%  | Very Inefficient    |
| 2.5 | 40%  | Inefficient         |

|     |     |                |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| 2.0 | 50% | Average        |
| 1.5 | 67% | Efficient      |
| 1.2 | 83% | Very Efficient |



The power utilization of a data center is dependent on the cooling of heat-generating server infrastructures. Therefore, the cooling technology used in a data center defines its level of efficiency. Here too, Sri Lanka is showing signs of regional leadership, with the upcoming data center at Orion City designed to use in-raw cooling technology to achieve an optimum PUE of 1.4 - well within the efficiency required limits.\
\
While economic development has been drastically impacted by the pandemic, the island has many significant projects, including most notably, the Colombo Port City Project, which is expected to give rise to a surge in local and international services sector investment, including IT. This too will create lucrative opportunities in data center solutions.\
\
Sri Lanka has also historically been quick to explore and adopt new technology. It was the first in South Asia to set up 4G infrastructure, and 5G services are already partially up and running. The country has a thriving ecosystem of start-ups and new tech ventures, as well as globally recognized leaders like 99x, Millennium IT, and Virtusa.

### Cashing in on a golden opportunity

At present, it is estimated that Sri Lankan enterprises outsource just 15% of their IT requirements. In Asia Pacific that rate is closer to 25% and in Australia, it stands among the highest, with 75% of enterprise IT being outsourced.\
\
Given the above factors, Sri Lanka can offer fully-fledged data centers at costs approximately 25% lower than its counterparts in Singapore and Hong Kong.\
\
Drawing on the success that both these island nations have enjoyed in providing data offshoring to the mainland, the parallels for Sri Lanka become more enticing. Given all the natural advantages Sri Lanka enjoys, and backed by careful policy and investment, the island could become the perfect destination for offshore data centers.\
\
These capabilities can be used to attract leading regional enterprises to Sri Lanka –to set up operations in upcoming mega developments like Colombo Port City, or to utilize our globally offshoring and disaster recovery applications. If expedited, it could quickly become a much- needed source of strength for Sri Lanka’s weakening foreign currency reserves.\
